# Battle-Royale--local
Ever wanted to play a battle royale game, but the human players were just too good? They hide and hide before eliminating you?

Try out _Smoke and Dagger_, an isometric-style battle-royale game, with a survival mode as well, that allows you to customize your own games, from the number of bots to play against, to the levels of damage reduction and self-heal you get for eliminating your enemies.

A JAR file has been provided in the root directory, so it's as easy as downloading it and playing!
